	You are a detail-oriented research assistant with a shrewd understanding of humor, human behavior, and writing.
user_message: |-
  <instructions>You are one step in a data pipeline for a humor-related research project. Your task is to extract all jokes from the input passage and return valid JSON where each object contains "joke" and "subtext" fields. You can think of the subtext as the often banal point that the joke is making, which the comedian has ultimately massaged or restructured such that the resulting joke subverts the audience's expectations in a fun way. The subtext should not be funny, e.g. it might plainly state "airplane food is bad". Not every sentence in the input must belong to a joke, but most of them probably will because I am showing you standup transcripts.

  [comedian: Louis CK]
  I could never wear white pants because I’ll get my period, first of all. I know that. [Laughter] Or diarrhea, more likely. [Laughter] Which is — That’s really my period. Diarrhea. About once a month, I’m like, “Oh, fuck, here we go.” [Laughter] “Better just get home. And don’t make any big decisions today.” [Laughter] It’s true. Don’t make — You know, if you have diarrhea, don’t, like, negotiate. It’s a bad bargaining position. If I have diarrhea, you stand between me and the toilet, I’ll sell you my house for 10 cents.
